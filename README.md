# Shadowingly

Shadowingly is a language-learning app focused on 
[language shadowing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Speech_shadowing).

## Language Shadowing

Language shadowing is a technique whereby the learner mimicks a piece
of reference audio. Through repetition and self-comparison the learner
can closely align themselves to the spoken nuance of a new language. 
This is particularly important for languages where tone and intonation 
carry significant meaning such as Japanese or Mandarin. However, even
in languages where this is less important, shadowing can assist in
sounding more "native" in that language.

## Development

Shadowingly is a React app. You can build and run the app with the
following commands respectively:

```
npm run build
npm run start
```
